Hiya. I am Eugene Chan, a data scientist + machine learning engineer in Toronto. 


After my undergrad in [`Hong Kong University of Science and Technology`](https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/), I pursued my AI postgraduate studies in [`Stanford University`](https://engineering.stanford.edu/), with concentration in `Natural Language Processing and LLMs` and `Graphical Neural Networks`.


Having extensive experience in Python for data software engineering, I am fluent with libraries and frameworks such as Pytorch, HuggingFace and [OpenAI API](https://github.com/skchanah/TextSummarizer),CUDA, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, scraping/API kits (beautifulsoup,requests,flask,selenium), PySpark, and others. Besides, C++ is also my primary programming language.


My hands-on machine learning applied research / optimization projects include:

- Heuristics (SVM, GAM, [EM](https://github.com/skchanah/SemiSupervisedEM/tree/main)) and Ensembles (XGBoost)  
- Natural Language Processing (N-gram, seq-2-seq) and LLMs ([GPT series](https://github.com/skchanah/MiniGPT), BART, BERT, RoBERTa, T5, LLaMA series via StackLLaMA & Ollama, RAG via LangChain & GraphRAG)
- Graphical Neural Network (GNN, GCN, GAT)
- Deep Generative Network (VAE, GAN, Diffusion)
- Computer Vision (YOLO-3)
- Currently I am intrigued and motivated by [Large Language Models as Optimizers (Yang et al., 2023)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.03409.pdf) and [Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Gu and Dao, 2023)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752.pdf)


I was previously based in Hong Kong working for different capacities across Pan-asian and Global portfolios in:
  
- Consulting @[EY](https://www.ey.com/) for Greater China coverage,
- Maritime @[Hutchison Ports](https://hutchisonports.com/en/) for Global coverage,
- Biopharmaceutical @[Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/) @[Merck Group](https://www.merck.com/) for Asia coverage,
- And lately in Toronto, Retail Finance @[Source One Financial](https://sourceonefinancial.ca/)


Bringing Art Education to everyone is always my dream and what I have been yearning to achieve with my life. I am an Art enthusiast (especially Asian Art) and a believer that Art embodies the quality of human-being - we are of free-will to create our own stories and values. My favourite artists are Claude Monet and recently [shumkwanyi](https://www.instagram.com/arsimsim/). My favorite architect is Kengo Kuma (I have been collecting miniature of his work). My favourite and calm-me-down piece of music is [Clair De Lune by Debussy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c977QdbTImU). Lately I am so astonished by film Oppenheimer by Christopher Nolan.


Being a big language nerd, I am currently picking up my German and Japanese in the meantime of learning Arabic. I built a [`language summariser`](https://github.com/skchanah/TextSummarizer) on my leisure time. 


Other Areas I could spend days and nights on:
  
- Environment, Sustainability and Behavioural Sciences
- Education Equality
- Healthcare
- Global Politics and Economy
- Innovations and Science
- Cats
