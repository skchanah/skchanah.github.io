Hiya. I am Eugene Chan, a data scientist of a Toronto-based auto-finance start-up, managing a subteam of data analysts. After my undergrad in [`Hong Kong University of Science and Technology`](https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/), I pursued my AI postgraduate studies in [`Stanford University`].

I was previously based in Hong Kong working for different capacities across Pan-asian and Global portfolios on:
    - `Consulting`,
    - `Maritime`,
    - `Biopharmaceutical`,
    - and lately, `Retail Finance`

Bringing Art Education to everyone is always my dream and what I have been yearning to achieve with my life. I am an Art enthusiast and living with a belief that Art embodies the quality of human-being - we are of free-will to create our own stories and values. My favourite artists are `Claude Monet` and recently [`shumkwanyi`](https://www.instagram.com/arsimsim/). My favorite architect is `Kengo Kuma` (I have been collecting miniature of his work). My favourite and calm-me-down piece of music is [`Clair De Lune by Debussy`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c977QdbTImU). Lately I am so astonished by film `Oppenheimer` by `Christopher Nolan`.

Other Areas I could spend days and nights on:
    - Education Equality
    - Global politics and economy
    - Innovations and Science
    - Cats
