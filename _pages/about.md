Hiya. I am Eugene Chan, a data scientist of a Toronto-based auto-finance start-up, managing a subteam of data analysts. 

After my undergrad in [`Hong Kong University of Science and Technology`](https://ais.hkust.edu.hk/), I pursued my AI postgraduate studies in [`Stanford University`](https://engineering.stanford.edu/), with concentration in `Natural Language Processing and LLMs` and `Graphical Neural Networks`.


I was previously based in Hong Kong working for different capacities across Pan-asian and Global portfolios on:
  
    - Consulting,
    - Maritime,
    - Biopharmaceutical,
    - and lately, Retail Finance


Bringing Art Education to everyone is always my dream and what I have been yearning to achieve with my life. I am an Art enthusiast (especially Asian Art) and a believer that Art embodies the quality of human-being - we are of free-will to create our own stories and values. My favourite artists are Claude Monet and recently [shumkwanyi](https://www.instagram.com/arsimsim/). My favorite architect is Kengo Kuma (I have been collecting miniature of his work). My favourite and calm-me-down piece of music is [Clair De Lune by Debussy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c977QdbTImU). Lately I am so astonished by film Oppenheimer by Christopher Nolan.


Being a big language nerd, I am currently picking up my German and Japanese in the meantime of learning Arabic. I built a [`language summariser`] on my leisure time. 


Other Areas I could spend days and nights on:
  
    - Environment, Sustainability and Behavioural Sciences
    - Education Equality
    - Global Politics and Economy
    - Innovations and Science
    - Cats
